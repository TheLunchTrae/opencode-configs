const TASK_STATE_GUIDANCE = `Preserve task control state in the summary. When the conversation established them, record:

- Task objective, active agent, and requested stopping point.
- Approved scope, non-goals, and actions that still require user permission. Discussion is not approval.
- Verification limits and their source: permitted checks, exclusions, and conditions for continuing without checks.
- Checks actually run: command, working directory, PASS, FAIL, BLOCKED, or SKIP, and the source state checked.
- Review findings and their disposition.
- Changed files, delegated work, file owners, and their status.
- Repair attempts used and remaining budget.
- Blockers and the next bounded action.

Keep exact paths, commands, identifiers, and error text. Mark unrecorded or uncertain items as unknown; do not
infer approvals or check results. Omit fields that do not apply.`;
